APM vs APCI : What Is The Difference
===============================================

## Intro To APM (Advanced Power Management)

The APM standard was developed by Microsoft and Intel in 1992 that allows the system to communicare with the BIOS in order to manage the state of power of the machine. The 3 states of power described by the APM standard are; Standby , Suspend and Off.

As this standard was developed in '92 it is widley considered to be the first power managment system within computers which leads to it having many very fundamental flaws such as its use of BIOS inturrupts. BIOS inturrupts are notoriously buggy leading to a demonstrably long list of [broken BIOS's](https://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v6.7.1/arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c#L2055). BIOS inturrupts are very BIOS dependent and due to the nature of such an ancient standard, the standard is either broken or nigh on impractacle on modern BIOS's. As well as this, symmetric multiprocessing (a method of handling multiple CPU's in a system) does not play well with the APM this is because the APM standard was originally designed for single-CPU systems, where the CPU is the central unit that manages power (making it much harder to ensure consistency and prevent one processor from entering a power-saving state while the other is still busy). However, the APM standard is much easier to implement into an OS than its more cool, more modern, less broken brother : ACPI (which we will get onto later).


## Implementing APM In A 32 Bit System

AlbaOS is a 32 bit, x86 system and will be implementing the APM standard in such a way that it is compatible with such a system. To summarise a high level view would go as follows: Check if the BIOS is compatible with APM, Connect and init the APM interface and then enables power management on the APM interface. When a power off function is called it will send a power request to the BIOS through BIOS interrupt 0x15. This then can be used to other APM shenanigans through sub-functions in the AX register (such as 0x5307 allowing you to set the power state or 0x530D allowing you to get the APM version).

## APM Code Explanation

[My implementation of the APM standard in AlbaOS](https://github.com/CamH04/AlbaOS/blob/34fc37e3b9f30dfd2b9fe131f295f3114ed33c2b/src/hardwarecommunication/power.cpp#L18)

The explained code was written in Jan 31 2025 (commit 237cbb5) so may be outdated or broken.
The implementation of APM is quite small only streaching across two files [power.cpp](https://github.com/CamH04/AlbaOS/blob/master/src/hardwarecommunication/power.cpp) and [apm_bios_call.s](https://github.com/CamH04/AlbaOS/blob/master/src/hardwarecommunication/apm_bios_call.s). This could have easily been completed in just the one c++ file however i prefer to split asm into seperate files for debugging and maintaining purposes.

The ASM (.s) file is just passing 4 16 bit flags to the respective registers which then returns the result as well as the flags. This is all done in this way in order to be able to call it in the C++ file as an external function:
```
extern "C" {
    uint16_t apm_bios_call(uint16_t ax, uint16_t bx, uint16_t cx, uint16_t dx);
}
```

In the C++ file we start by doing a APM installation check (```apm_bios_call(0x5300) ```) and if supported we then connect to the interface(```apm_bios_call(0x5303)```). We then enable power management(```apm_bios_call(0x5308)```) to finish the init stages of APM.

Once all that is done we can the call power off which works as follows
```
uint16_t ax = 0x5307;
uint16_t bx = 0x0001;   // All devices
uint16_t cx = 0x0003;   // Power state = OFF

// make bios call
asm volatile(
    "int $0x15\n\t"
    "setc %0\n\t"
    : "=r"(APM_error)
    : "a"(ax), "b"(bx), "c"(cx)
    : "memory", "cc"
);
```

## Intro To ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)

The ACPI standard was birthed in 1996 as a standardised abstraction for an operating system to manage power states instead of having to use direct BIOS calls. ACPI replaces the APM spec as it allows for more dynamic and intelligent power management schemes when compared to APM. This all stem from ACPI handing control to the OS.

The OS can manage separate components power state, this is done by having a set of ACPI tables in which the hardware is IDâ€™d as well as its specifications being inserted into these tables, these are the tables the OS interacts with to understand in what way to manage power states for the hardware. There are many sets of tables some of them being optional, I will only cover the ones listed as required by arm64 systems in the linux kernel as of Oct 2020 [Link Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020091509/https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arm64/acpi_object_usage.html).

+ DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table): Contains primary component definitions and compatible power management features

+ FADT (Fixed ACPI Description Table): Provides gives static component info and pointers to other ACPI tables

+ GTDT (Generic Timer Description Table): Provides OS info about generic timers, eg interrupt timer

+ MADT (Multiple APIC Description Table): Provides info about interrupt controllers

+ MCFG (Memory-mapped ConFiGuration space): Provides PCI/PCIe information

+ RSDP (Root System Description Pointer): Pointer to RSDT table

+ SPCR (Serial Port Console Redirection table): Gives info on serial port configuration

+ XSDT (eXtended System Description Table): More physical pointers of headers to other description tables.


The tables are encoded into a language called AML (ACPI Machine Language) of which the OS has to decipher which then allows (when commands are interpreted) for the OS to be able to manage power directly.
