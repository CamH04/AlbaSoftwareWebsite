My Goals (2025)
==============================================

### 6th July 2025, [Cameron](https://camhdeveloper.netlify.app/)



This year has been an up and a down in many ways for me, many adversary's conquered with many new ones coming to the battlefield , such is life.

I have had some immense burnout as well as the ballooning of my passion for computer science, its infinite seeming scope never failing to inspire in both technical and philosophical ways. With my passion consistently growing means I have put more and more of my spare time into  sharpening and expanding my knowledge by building projects of various sizes ([AlbaOS](https://github.com/CamH04/AlbaOS) , [NeuralNetworkFromScratch](https://github.com/CamH04/NeuralNetworkFromScratch) , Various Video Games, and many more will will go un-noted here) as well as theory crafting / researching ideas im passionate about (Effects Of Quantum Computing within operating systems / embedded systems , A file system optimised for smaller flash storage (SD cards) , philosophical impacts of computing, chess engines). While I still have so much to learn I will push myself to learn as much as I can.

I cannot understate the positive impact academia has had on me as not only a developer but as a person. It is something I wish to pursue for many more years to come as I am only at the start of my journey (Bsc Computer Science) where as I wish to aim further, for a Msc In Advanced Computer Science / adjacent degrees such as MPhil in Advanced Computer Science. From then forward I would like to work towards a PhD. Research is something im beyond exited about , I do it as is on a small scale by myself. This is all for the end goal of trying to become a professor of computer science. Teaching the subject matter I love so much sounds like a dream to me.

To stray from the point of academics and computer science I am putting a lot of work into improving my ability in chess, it is a wonderful game which I love studying and playing and will push myself to do it more alongside my studies (who knows, I may be able to do both at the same time).

I am just a 20 year old kid with a dream that may be a bit far fetched for him, while i may have doubts in myself most of the time all Ill keep doing is pushing because at the end of the day, this is the stuff I love, computer science. I want to push the feild one day but I know I am very far away from that however that doesnâ€™t hamper my love for learning, while some voice at the back of my head nag to me to accept working a coding job after Uni (which I wont complain about at all), I wish to aim for different goals. They will fulfill me and overall, there's an argument to be made that fulfillment is a core pillarstone towards a happy life.

I hope this didnt come of big headed, i am not a fantastic writer this has jst been a slightly edited stream of consciousness.

Thank you for reading, it truley means the world

All the best!
