The Heaviness Of Hearthian Life
==============================================================

# Warning!
Spoilers for outer wilds are writhe within this article, i recommend playing the game before reading as the greatest emotion comes from the curiosity and discovery of piecing together the poignant and unusual solar system when no prerequisite knowledge is present to the player.

# Time And Repetition
The hearthian’s , the alien race of the character you play as throughout outer wilds are in general a content group of people, living on a sublimely picturesque earth akin planet known as timber hearth. I say “in general” to the aspect of them being content as one could derive a sense of dread, fear, helplessness and many other such emotions from one of the key mechanics of the game, the 22 minute ever present clock of each “life” as the sun goes supernova of which, we assume this solar systems star is much lager than our own tiny star, is an inevitability. A very cosmic and existential one at that. After the sun goes supernova, you wake up again. Back at your sleeping bag ready to “slip the surly bonds”(Magee JG 1941) of timber hearth. This loop represents a very literal instance of eternal return. This pushes the player is forced to confront the repetition of life itself, of death and of finding a meaning within a cyclical existence.

# Lightness And Heaviness
A cyclical and constant existence is explored within the book , The Unbearable Lightness of Being (Milan Kundera 1984). In the book characters are used to portray the concept of heaviness in an eternal existence. Heaviness refers to the weight of eternal return, that if life repeats infinitely our choices in life gain tremendous significance and responsibility therefore giving one the “heaviest of burdens” which pins us to the earth and makes life deeply true and real. This is explored through the character Tereza as her struggles with her partners infidelities display the burden of eternal attachment and suffering.

However a contrary point to eternal life is traversed, the concept of lightness. Tomas embodies lightness, experiencing life as carefree and unbound by lasting consequence as a result of being born into a new life once this one ends. The tension lies in how heaviness can be crushing yet fulfilling, whereas lightness offers freedom but also existential insignificance and helplessness.

Riebeck is much like Tereza with the acknowledgment in the past’s weight and the future’s building on it, symbolizing engagement, attachment, and existential weight. While Gabboro is much like Tomas, showing a detachment from the inevitable loop as well as displaying an almost mediative state manifesting itself in Gabboro being playfully care free with an acceptance of his current corporal being having a lack of permanence.

The protagonist character themselves reflects a balance experiencing the loop’s burden first-hand but driven by curiosity and hope, symbolizing the tension between heaviness and lightness in the search for meaning within recurrence. The player as a human may feel a difference to the character they interact with this world.

# Acceptance, Resistance And Value
This solar system to me was a one of helplessness and burden, of trying within my infinitely allotted time spans to find an answer to any question I had. It would eat away at me is I come to accept my lack of strength in combating the inevitability of death and of the start of a new life, in a way I wanted to not wake up in my sleeping bag as another representation of my previous self. To escape the burdens of trying to resist, I wanted to use the pasts weight and the futures building on it to help somebody or to even selfishly contribute to my own need for answers, that became my value in being pinned, being true to life. Much like Riebeck. The heaviness weighed greatly, most crushing in the attachment I gained towards the other travelers and characters of the solar system.

But throughout the experience of the game I gained a deep sense of acceptance, of being able to detach from the inevitable, to let it all happen. To allow myself the option of failure in vain, allowing myself to waste precious time not searching for answers but to find meaning within this eternal landscape, instead of finding answers.  To be free within the sandbox of the cosmos.
